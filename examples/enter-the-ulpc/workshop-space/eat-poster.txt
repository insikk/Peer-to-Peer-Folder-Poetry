Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.) was a non-profit and tax-exempt organization established to develop collaborations between artists and engineers.
The group operated by facilitating person-to-person contacts between artists and engineers, rather than defining a formal process for cooperation.
E.A.T. initiated and carried out projects that expanded the role of the artist in contemporary society and helped explore the separation of the individual from technological change.
